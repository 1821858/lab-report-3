# The "Find" Command

The find command is a very useful command that has plenty of versatile options.

The first option I learned through a website called softwareengineeringhelp.com. I got there by googling "find command options".

This is a simple option, it's to add the letter "i" in front of -name. like so:

-iname

What this does is tells the find command to not be case sensitive to the name you give it.
